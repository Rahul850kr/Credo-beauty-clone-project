# Credo-beauty-clone-project
Collaborative Project At Masai School “Credo Beauty”.
this is my first Collaborative project At Masai School, I want to thank Masai School for this great opportunity and for providing this wonderful platform to discover my coding skill.
project details:
We had to make a clone of the credo beauty website. this website is all about the beauty product. Clean is more than hype or a hashtag.
It’s our mission. We do the work to examine what goes into products and onto your skin.
